  "description": "This is a collection of copyright free books aligned by Andras Farkas, which are available from http://www.farkastranslations.com/bilingual_books.php\nNote that the texts are rather dated due to copyright issues and that some of them are manually reviewed (check the meta-data at the top of the corpus files in XML). The source is multilingually aligned, which is available from http://www.farkastranslations.com/bilingual_books.php. In OPUS, the alignment is formally bilingual but the multilingual alignment can be recovered from the XCES sentence alignment files. Note also that the alignment units from the original source may include multi-sentence paragraphs, which are split and sentence-aligned in OPUS.\nAll texts are freely available for personal, educational and research use.
